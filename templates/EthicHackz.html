        <h3 style="display:inline;" id="int">Definition  : </h3>
        <p id="definition" style="display: inline-block;"> Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating the strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.</p>
        <p id="definition" > Hacking is the process of finding vulnerabilities in a system and using these found vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access into the system to perform malicious activities ranging from deleting system files to stealing sensitive information. Hacking is illegal and can lead to extreme consequences if you are caught in the act. People have been sentenced to years of imprisonment because of hacking. </p>

        <h3 style="display: inline;" id="int">Definition  : </h3>
        <p id="definition" style="display: inline-block;">Also called black hat hacking, unethical hacking is the act of accessing a computer system or account for which they do not have authorization, usually without the target owner's awareness. Unethical hacking is used to steal information or money, intercept communications between other parties, and sometimes, insert viruses or malware to cause problems or damage systems.</p>
        <p id="definition" >Unethical hacking is against the law, and those who engage in the act are considered cyber criminals.</p>
